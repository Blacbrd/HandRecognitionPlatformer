# HandRecognitionPlatformer
OCR A level (2024) comptuer science project that links hand recognition with 2D platforming

This game is about a wizard that is trapped in a cave. They have to try and escape a series of puzzles to make their way out to the surface. They complete these puzzles by using their platforming skills, alongside their magical abilities: Fireball, a standard horizontally travelling projectile; WaterFountain, which is a rising platform of water and LightningBolt, a projectile that crashes down from the ceiling and dissapears when it comes into contact with the floor.

I had 1 year to complete this project, including forming an analysis, developing the program, formulating multiple test plans, receiving stakeholder feedback and then evaluating my code.

What you see in the files is the final state of the code for when I submitted the code. Due to time constraints, it may be messy, unoptimised, and have potential privacy issues (especially regarding the terminal commands). However, I ended up making something that I thought wasn't possible, therefore expanding my programming experience.

I do not plan on finishing this game, or improving the code, as I am currently working on other projects.
